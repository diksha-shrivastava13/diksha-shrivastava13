I’m an AI Research Engineer exploring the intersection of AI, reasoning, and scientific discovery. For the past year, I’ve been working on bridging language models’ internal representations with structured models of complex worlds, enabling them to uncover deep causal relationships and fundamental rules governing vast systems—critical for AI-driven scientific discovery. My research interests include AI for Scientific Discovery, Continual Learning in Complex World Models, Decision-Making in Language Models, and Language Model Reasoning.
