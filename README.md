# Hi there 👋, I'm Diksha Shrivastava

* 🔭 I've recently finished delivering -
  * 🗽 LLM-based Decision-Making Aid for Country Policies with Reasoning and Analysis Pipelines from a complex hierarchy of unstructured reports. 
  * 🔍 Custom Perplexity for internal technical documentation and communication, with continual learning from user feedback. 
* 🌱 I'm currently learning -
  * ☘️ Distributed Systems in ML and GPU Programming.
  * 🪄 Literally everything in the world. It never ends.
* ⚡️ I'm currently working on - 
  * 😵‍💫 Approaches for Reasoning in Language Models.
  * 🎯 A (hopefully) better (and abstract) data representation of linked entities.
  * 🖇️ Next link, similar link and missing link prediction with LLMs.
* 💬 Ask me about -
  * ❄️ B2B SaaS, Production ML Systems, LLM Reasoning.
  * 🙃 I yap quite freely.

* 🧚‍♀️ Fun facts -
  * 💭 I've been found reading some research paper in the corner way too often in college (my current favourites are [LeanAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06209#) and [Pantograph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16429v1) on lifelong learning, theorem proving and high-level reasoning!) 
  * ❤️ I almost certainly end up being the Tinkerbell of the teams I join. I love to research, and this side-obsession is what inadvertently brings the awesome factor to the products I've delivered. Love research, research is a must!
  * 🙌 Too many people have too many stories of me falling down when I was busy laughing over nothing. This is an indication of stress.
